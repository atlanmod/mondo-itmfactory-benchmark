Acknowledgment
----------------------
0) This project aims to serve as a benchmark for scalable ATL transformations 
1) These transformations are all coming from the MoDisco project
2) Some inputs are realistic, and recovered using some MoDisco discoverers 
---------------
Prerequisites:
---------------
1) Install Eclipse with EMF + ATL :

	--> You can use the Eclipse market place to install both projects.    		

-----------------------------------------
This project organization
-----------------------------------------
						
	--> "models":		The metamodels, used within this projects, expressed in .ecore
							
	--> "inputs":		Sample inputs to run the different transformations, these inputs have different sizes.
						Their names are delivered in a way to help users figure out to which metamodel they conform to.
						For example, setX.java.xmi is conform to the java metamodel 	
							
	--> "transformations:	The transformations that this project contains
	
	--> "builds" : the different ant scripts aiming to launch the different transformations
	
-------------------------------------------
Launching a transformation 
------------------------------------------	

The "build-XXX.xml" ANT scripts,  allow executing the different transformations available here in the project,
Note that the values of the properties must be set for each one of the scripts before launching.
